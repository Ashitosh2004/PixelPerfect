### üîë Core Features

1. **Authentication (Firebase Only)**

   * Use **Firebase Authentication** for user login/signup (Email/Password + Google login).
   * Store user profile info (name, email, role: user/admin) in MongoDB.
   * Admin users can manage all users & see complete upload history.
   * Protect backend APIs by verifying Firebase ID tokens with **Firebase Admin SDK**.

2. **Excel File Upload & Parsing**

   * Users upload `.xls` or `.xlsx` files.
   * Use **Multer** in backend for file uploads.
   * Parse files with **SheetJS/xlsx**.
   * Dynamically extract column headers.

3. **Data Visualization**

   * Let users select **X-axis** and **Y-axis** from Excel data.
   * Generate charts with **Chart.js** (bar, line, pie, scatter).
   * Add **3D chart support** with **Three.js**.
   * Allow users to **download charts** as PNG or PDF.

4. **Dashboard**

   * Show **upload history** for each user (saved in MongoDB).
   * Each history record stores filename, date, chart type, and downloadable graph.
   * Admin dashboard with user management.

5. **Responsive UI**

   * Use **React.js + Tailwind CSS** for modern responsive design.
   * Mobile friendly and simple to use.
